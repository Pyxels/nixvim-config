# Pyxels Neovim

This is my personal Neovim config using [Nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim).
Compared to my [previous lua config](https://github.com/Pyxels/nvim-config) this is a lot more simple with some seldom used features and overcomplicated configs missing (and it has grown to be a bit different over time).

## Try it out

If you want to run this config just run:

```
nix run github:pyxels/nixvim-config
```
